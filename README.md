Machine Learning examples taught by Andrew Ng (Coursera-Standford)

# All the assignments use Matlab/Octave.

# List of topics

ex1) Linear Regression(w/ Gradient Descent and Normal equation), Feature Scaling.

ex2) Logistic Regression using advance optimization algorithm, reularization, and non-linear decision boundarys.

ex3) Multiclass classification (One-vs-all and Neuronetworks) to classify handwritten digits. The weights params are provided for Neuronetwork

ex4) Regularize Neuronetwork cost function and gradient. Use Numerical Estimate to check the gradient. Apply advance optimization method with Backpropagation algorithm to minimize cost(Theta) and find the set of weights(Theta).
